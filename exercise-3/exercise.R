# Exercise 3: Vector and function practice

# Create a vector `marbles` with 6 different colors in it (representing marbles)
marbles <- c("red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "orange", "black")

# Use the `sample` function to select a single marble
choice <- sample(marbles, 1)

# Write a function MarbleGame that does the following:
# - Takes in a `guess` of a marble color
# - Randomly samples a marble
# - Returns whether or not the person guessed accurately (preferrably a full phrase)

MarbleGame <- function(guess) {
  result <- choice
  if (guess == result) {
    return("You're right")
  } else {
    return ("You're wrong"
    )
  }
}
# Play the marble game!

MarbleGame("red")
# Bonus: Play the marble game until you win, keeping track of how many tries you take


## Double bonus(answer not provided): play the game 1000X (until you win) and track the average number of tries
# Is it what you expected based on the probability
